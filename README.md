# ski-language-parser
Parser implementation for a proof-of-concept language based on SKI combinator calculus.

_This project is a part of 2110316 Programming Languages Principles course,
Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University._

## Name
The language does not have a name (yet) since this is just a small project made for fun.
The name of this repository is chosen as it briefly describes what we are trying to achieve.

## Usage
```sh
python3 parser.py FILE
```
- `FILE` is the path to the source code input.

## Example
An example "Hello world" program is provided in `helloworld`.
